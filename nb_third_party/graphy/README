Graphy

Graphy is a chart library for python. It tries to get out of the way and just
let you work with your data.

For more information, see http://code.google.com/p/graphy/

For license info, see the LICENSE file.

INSTALLATION:
No installer yet, so just manually copy graphy/ into python-lib/graphy.

QUICK START:
from graphy.backends import google_chart_api
monthly_rainfall = [3.2, 3.2, 2.7, 0.9, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.9, 1.8, 2.3]
months = 'Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec'.split()
chart = google_chart_api.LineChart(monthly_rainfall)
chart.bottom.labels = months
print chart.display.Url(400, 100)

EXAMPLES:
The examples in the examples/ directory assume graphy is in the PYTHONPATH.
If just want to run them without installing graphy first, you will need to do
something like this:
  $ cd examples
  $ PYTHONPATH=.. ./traffic.py
